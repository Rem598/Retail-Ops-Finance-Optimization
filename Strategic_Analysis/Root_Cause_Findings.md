# Root Cause Analysis: Sales & Operations Performance

## Executive Summary
Following a review of regional sales data and fulfillment metrics, we identified two critical issues impacting company performance: fulfillment bottlenecks in the North Region and inventory shortages in the East Region.

## 1. Issue: Fulfillment Delays (North Region)
[cite_start]**Observation:** The North region currently exhibits the highest average fulfillment delay across the company at **6.97 days**[cite: 479].

[cite_start]**Root Cause:** Data drilling reveals the bottleneck originates specifically from **Warehouse WH-4**, which has an average delay of **7.63 days**[cite: 480], significantly higher than the regional average.

**Recommendation:** Initiate an immediate process audit of Warehouse WH-4 to identify operational inefficiencies (staffing, layout, or system errors) to protect North region sales.

## 2. Issue: Low Revenue Performance (East Region)
[cite_start]**Observation:** The East region generated the lowest total revenue, recorded at **$7.67 Million**[cite: 481].

[cite_start]**Root Cause:** Correlation analysis shows the East region also maintains the lowest average inventory level (**475.78 units**)[cite: 482]. This suggests revenue is being capped by stock-outs rather than lack of demand.

**Recommendation:** Increase inventory allocation to the East region distribution centers immediately to capture unmet demand.
